- 👋 Hi, I’m Huy Nguyen (Little_34306) (@34306).
- 📖 I'm already finished BSc in Electronics and Telecommunications (Advanced Program) at Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), now go for MSc.
- 👀 I’m interested in Reverse Engineer and/or stuff related to iOS/iPadOS/macOS!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C/C++/Objective-C/Swift.
- 🗣️ Not a real developer, I'm just copycat things from Internet and make it 'works on my machine'.
