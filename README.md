- 📖 I'm studying Electronics and Telecommunications (Advanced Program) at Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST).
- 👀 I’m interested in Reverse Engineer and/or stuff related to iOS/iPadOS/macOS!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C/C++/Objective-C/Swift.
- 🗣️ Not a real developer, I'm just copycat things from Internet and make it 'works on my machine'.
